//   * the store root is owned by the operator and is not world-writable;
//   * the library refuses paths that escape the root, that name a Windows
//     device, that place a path separator or control character inside a
//     component, or that resolve through a symbolic link, junction or other
//     reparse point;
//   * checks are performed immediately before each operation. A determined
//     attacker who can already replace entries inside the store directory at
//     the exact moment of a call is outside the trust model; the checks defend
//     against accidental substitution and naive path attacks.
//
// Durability is never assumed. Every entry point that can order authoritative
// bytes or the replacement of a directory entry through the storage device
// takes an explicit durable flag, and no operation reports durability it did
// not establish.
