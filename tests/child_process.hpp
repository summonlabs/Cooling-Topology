// Independent-process helper for the durability and crash-consistency suite.
// It uses only narrow native OS abstractions, blocks until a child exits (there
// is no timed wait in this file) and terminates a child only through
// TerminateProcess or SIGKILL, so no interactive error-reporting path - and in
// particular no Windows crash dialog - can ever be reached.
//
// Child roles. The test runner in tests/test_main.cpp is frozen and rejects
// every argument it does not define, so a child role cannot ride in a
// command-line argument. A child is therefore started as
//
//   <this executable> --filter=<child case name>
//
// and receives its role and arguments through its own environment
// (COOLING_TOPOLOGY_TEST_CHILD_ROLE plus COOLING_TOPOLOGY_TEST_CHILD_ARG_<n>).
// spawn_child() sets those entries for that child alone and never modifies the
// environment of the calling process. The child case itself inspects
// child_invocation() and returns immediately when it was not started in its
// role, so an ordinary full-suite run executes every child case as a no-op.
